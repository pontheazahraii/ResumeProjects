## Techinical Report Breakdown

### Introduction

An introduction should introduce the problem you're working on, give some background and relevant detail for the reader, and explain why it is important.

### Analysis

Any exploratory analysis of your data, and general summarization of the data (e.g. summary statistics, correlation heatmaps, graphs, information about the data...). This can also include any cleaning and joining you did.

### Methods

Explain the structure of your model and your approach to building it. This can also include changes you made to your model in the process of building it. Someone should be able to read your methods section and _generally_ be able to tell exactly what architechture you used.

### Results

Detailed discussion of how your model performed, and your discussion of how your model performed.

### Reflection

Reflections on what you learned/discovered in the process of doing the assignment. Things you would do differently in the future, ways you'll approach similar problems in the future, etc.
